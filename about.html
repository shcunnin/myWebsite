										<h1>About Me</h1>
									</header>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/me.jpg"  /></span>
									<p>I am a geospatial scientist and an aspring ecologist with a diverse research background. I have worked on a number of applied projects in the field of environmental science over the past few years, and have gained experience in several areas including spatial ecology, fire ecology, invasive plant monitoring, etc. My technical background is in GIS and remote sensing, and I've enjoyed applying these technologies to different environmental issues. </p>
									<p>I graduated from the University of Maryland with a degree in Geography and was fortunate to land an opportunity with the NASA DEVELOP program as a part-time researcher. The NASA DEVELOP program seeks adress environmental problems and make geospatial tools more accessible through 10-week long feasiblity studies. Teams of 4-5 come on and work with a partner organization to address a particular problem. I was immediately hooked and went on the complete two more projects with the program. I quickly learned I loved applied research, and working with diverse partners to help solve their issues. In 2021 I accepted a fulltime position with the program leading their Colorado location and managing projects. This position was less technical, and required more project planning, collaborating with partners, and team-building and guidance through project lifecycles. My time with the DEVELOP program was invalvuable; I became an experienced researcher, learned countless new technical skills, learned how to develop lasting relationships with project parnters, realized my passion for ecology and conservation, and more. I currently work as a field technician and data analyst for the Natural Resource Ecology Lab at Colorado State University. I've been loving getting hands-on experience on a variety of research projects in this beautiful state. </p>
									<p>I hope to continue my career in Enviornmental Science, and my goal is to apply my skills to conservation projects, the field of ecology, and the issues associated with climate change.</p>
